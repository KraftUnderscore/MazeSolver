# MazeSolver
My first programming project for my university. This application allows you to input an image of a maze and it outputs solutions created with different algorithms.
## Mazes
Each input image has to meet certain criteria( examples are provided in the <i>Mazes</i> folder):
- 1 pixel is equal to 1 maze field,
- the maze needs to be only black and white,
- border of the maze must be black,
- there is only one entrance at the top and only one exit at the bottom.
## Algorithms
There are a few selectable algorithms:
- BFS,
- DFS,
- Djikstra,
- Greedy,
- AStar.

Output shows the path which selected algorithm took as well as the time in which the maze was solved.
